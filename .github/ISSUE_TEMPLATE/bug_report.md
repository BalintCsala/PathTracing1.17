**Description of the bug**
Describe the bug in a concise way, examples:
- When I try loading the shader, it fails.
- There are black spots on the blocks.

**Resourcepack in use**
Which resourcepack are you using? E.g. Vanillaccurate, VNR, etc.

**System information**
The specs of your computer, example:
GPU: Nvidia RTX 3070
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5400
OS: Windows 11

**Screenshots**
(Optional)
If applicable, add screenshots of the problem.
Valid reasons to not add screenshots:
- The issue is 100% explained by the text above (e.g. shader doesn't load)
- There's no way to take screenshots (e.g. shader crashes the game)
Invalid reasons to not add screenshots:
- "I just closed the game, I can't be bothered to open it again"
- "The text will definitely explain the visual glitches I'm seeing"
- "I don't know how to take screenshots"

**Attach the logs**
You can find these in the logs/latest.log folder inside the minecraft folder. Alternatively if you experienced a crash, send the most recent file named hs_err_pid<some number>.log as well.

Optimally you should follow these steps:
1. Close the game if it isn't already closed
2. Launch the game again
3. Load the shader
4. Close the game
