# Installation

If you just intend to use the shader, **do not** download it from here. This repository only serves as a place to store the source code in case anyone would like to study it in some way. Instead go to [my patreon](https://www.patreon.com/balintshaders) (versions are available early to patreons and become public after a month). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/vpt-2-early-test-69912873)

# About the shader

The aim of this shader is to implement path tracing (a way to calculate global illumination) without any third party mods, only using the built-in shader pipeline Minecraft provides.

The name (VanillaPuddingTart) is an abbreviated and (badly) unabbreviated version of vanilla path tracing.
