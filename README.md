# Path tracing 1.17 shader

Disclaimer: This shader is WIP. It is not complete in any shape or form, it still has the following very obvious problems:
 - No support for non-full blocks~~, translucent blocks~~ and blocks with different textures on some sides
 - ~~Dawn and night just straight up breaks it, only play at noon~~ (Fixed)
 - Some camera glitches
 - No view bobbing

## How to install

Make sure you use the latest snapshots (21w16a+)! This also only works if the resolution of your monitors exceeds or matches 1024x768 in both directions

 1. Press the green `â¤“ Code` button and select "Download ZIP"
 2. Extract the content of the ZIP file to your resource pack folder
 3. Start the game and enter into a world (a superflat with the void preset is a good starting point, as most normal worlds don't work)
 4. Go into video settings and set Graphics to _Fabulous!_
 5. Go into resource packs and enable the path tracing resource pack. Make sure to disable anything else, even if they don't have shaders.
